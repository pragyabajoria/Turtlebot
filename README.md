# Turtlebot

Build a Turtlebot from scratch to perform Mapping and Navigation using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping). TurtleBot combines popular off-the-shelf robot components like the iRobot Create, Yujin Robot's Kobuki and Microsoft's Kinect into an integrated development platform for ROS applications.
